   "The Gelsemis are a race of highly evolved plant-humanoids originating from Viridescent planets. Having adapted to the Viridescent's toxic environments Gelsemis are heavily resistant to any type of toxin or acid. Despite having evolved from plants in a similar manner to the Florans, Gelsemis tend to avoid engaging in combat unless it is absolutely necessary. Most Gelsemis still reside in the sprawling toxic cities of the Viridescent planets."
