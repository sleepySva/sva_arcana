   "Viridescent planets are vibrantly green, horrifically toxic planets filled with rivers of acidic ichor. Some remains of civilization still linger, but these planets have been inhospitable for a long time, with most species not daring to set foot on them. Plant life can be found rarely, but most of them have evolved to be lethal on touch, with a select few evolving terrestrial mobility or even flight capabilities."
