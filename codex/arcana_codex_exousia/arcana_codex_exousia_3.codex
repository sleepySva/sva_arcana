  "Order is one of the foundational pillars of the ^#c3483a;Exousian Empire^reset;, and it is the duty of the Imperial Police to enforce it by any means necessary, even at the cost of the freedom of those supposedly under their protection. Wielding specially engineered non-lethal plasma weapons they constantly patrol the Exousian cities in their distinctive heavy white armor, searching for any signs of unrest in their districts."
