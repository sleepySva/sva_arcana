   "Exousia is known for being an enormous authoritarian empire under the rule of the Lionheart Emperor, Zelheim. The Empire is divided into four major powers, the Sovereign, the Imperial Army, the Imperial Police, and the Church of Dunamis. While the Empire is at peace with most other factions, many still take increased caution when conducting business with Exousians out of fear of the Empire's massive military power."
