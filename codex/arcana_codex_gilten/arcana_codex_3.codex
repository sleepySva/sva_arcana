"The ^orange;Aurea Collective^reset; is long known as an universal artifact safekeeping order, founded by the Gilten. At its head is the ^orange;Artificer^reset;, who oversees preservation of artifacts as well as the development of Gilten technology.",

"Day after day, the Aurea's Excavators and Inquisitors travel to many distant planets, in search of lost artifacts from the Ancient Ages.

The Artificer has ruled that the Gilten must preserve and protect these artifacts from evil's reach, so that peace may prosper within the universe."
