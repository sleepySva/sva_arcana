    "The Workshop is known for dismantling planets and extracting as many resourcesas they can from sites, often leaving planets polluted. The same Workshop has, however, managed to create a device capable of cleansing entire planets similar to that of the ancient terraformers. The E.C.O, or Environment Cleanse Operator, requires a significant amount of resources to operate, but it has shown to be a highly capable terraforming device."
