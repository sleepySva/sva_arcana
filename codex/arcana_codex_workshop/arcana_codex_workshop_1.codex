    "The Workshop is an organization hosted by a group of talented engineers specialized in mass producing combat machinery. Many planets occupied by the Workshop have turned into Automated planets, planets that are composed entirely of rusting metal and machine parts. While the Workshop supplies many galactic companies with their goods, direct interaction with the engineers of the Workshop is discouraged as they are highly hostile to outsiders."
