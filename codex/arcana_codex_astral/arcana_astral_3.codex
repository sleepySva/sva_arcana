"Naturally, the Guild of Elemental Arts has long been the prominent guild in the city of the arcane. The guild has a vast number of members, even outside the Arcanian race. Though the Arcane City is full of the students of the Arts, there are also plenty who have dedicated themselves to the Forge and the Harvest, two of the sub-guilds of the city's circulation. ^orange;The Forge^reset;, with fire as its primary element, consists of skilled smiths, armorers, craftsmen and warriors. ^orange;The Harvest^reset;, with poison as its primary element, is the guild of druids and farmers. As for the fourth guild and their technomancers, they've unfortunately been largely outcasted after their reputation took a dive."
