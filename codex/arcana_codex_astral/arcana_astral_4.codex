"In addition to regular staves, the mages of the city also wield a variety of non-magic weapons as sidearms and specially made magic armaments. Melee weapons such as swords and gaunlets are a popular choice for close-combat mages, as they can infuse their weapons with an element to enhance their attacks. Experienced rangers can fire off elemental arrows, or infuse their throwing weapons. With enough training, talented sorcerers can also wield magic without an armament."
