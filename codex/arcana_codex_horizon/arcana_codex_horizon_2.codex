	"Even in an Universe with infinite resources and possibilities pain and suffering still remain. How can we call this an utopia when hatred remains deeply rooted in all of our hearts? There is no other way forward, even if we must unleash a calamity never dreamed of upon existence, we must bring harmony and unity across the cosmos. The World Horizon will be both our final judgment and an everlasting cure to our scarred and broken universe."
