In the midst, the Collective expanded itself to seek the path of the Ancients, while the Horizon's soldiers followed in the shadows.\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/VXJpWUU.png[/img]\n\n[b]Aurea Collective Outpost, Lighthaven[/b]\nYou can now visit a preview of Lighthaven, one of the Collective's space stations.
